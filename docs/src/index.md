General relativity is Albert Einstein's theory of gravitation.
Gravity in our own solar system is relatively weak, and Newton's 
law of universal gravitation works very well for most purposes.
General relativity predicts new gravitational phenomena, such as
black holes, neutron stars, an expanding universe, and gravitational
radiation.

Gravitational waves are generated by accelerating masses.
They are analogous to electromagnetic radiation and carry information 
about changes in the gravitational field.  Gravitational waves
have recently been discovered by the gravitational wave observatories
[LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) and [Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/).
These waves are created in merging binaries with either black holes
or neutron stars.

Unfortunately, the Einstein equations of general relativity are very
difficult to solve, especially for the binary systems that generate 
gravitational waves.  The equations can be solved with numerical
methods on supercomputers, and now even on some home computers.  Learning
the techniques of numerical relativity takes a lot of time, because
it requires background in general relativity, numerical analysis, 
and computer skills.

The purpose of this project is to give some examples for beginners
of solving equations numerically.  These notes begin with some
some examples solving ordinary differential equations.  They usually
begin with some easier examples, then progress to cases that require some
general relativity.  This way the reader can see how these techniques
can be used in relativity research.  

The different examples are listed in the tabs on the left.  The documentation
briefly describes the equations and the numerical methods used 
to find the solution.  Example Jupyter notebooks are found in the example
directory of the [numex](https://github.com/davidneilsen/numex.jl)
repository.

While I wish that these notes could
be more pedagogical, for now the descriptions are brief, with pointers to
other published materials. You may need to ask your teacher or instructor
for additional help to supplement these examples.
Finally, each section ends with project ideas 
that a student could pursue to gain additional skills.

The source code for this project is written in Julia 
and can be accessed in the GitHub repository 
[numex](https://github.com/davidneilsen/numex.jl). 


## What is Julia?

[Julia](https://julialang.org) is a 
modern dynamic language similar to Python. Julia is fast, easily parallelized,
and ideal for scientific computing, while also being easy to use.
Julia uses just-in-time compilation to native computer code, which makes 
its performance nearly as fast as native C code. 


## Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are an interactive way to run
Julia and python code in a web browser.  This repository contains several
Jupyter notebooks to give some simple examples of the numerical problems
discussed here.
